It covers prerequisites, genome references (including making a human reference with `mkref`), preparing FASTQs, running `cellranger count`, and interpreting key outputs. Commands are provided as Bash chunks you can run on Linux. Adjust paths and resource flags to match your system.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nSingle cell RNA-seq workflows are typically broken into three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary analysis. Primary analysis handles the initial processing of raw sequencing output, including assigning reads to samples based on their barcode indices and trimming the reads. Then the reads are aligned to a reference and a quantitative measures of gene expression is generated as a count matrix. Secondary analysis involves dimensionality reduction and clustering, and finally tertiary analysis centers on interpreting the data biologically, most of the time through annotating the cells and performing differential gene expression testing and enrichment analyses such as GO or gene set enrichment.\n\nThere are several analysis pipelines developed to perform the primary analysis step of the single cell data analysis and your choice sometimes depend on the method by which the library was generated:\n\n- [STAR solo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/docs/STARsolo.md): This tool is built into the general purpose STAR aligner and generates outputs very similar to Cell Ranger minus the cloupe file and the QC report (see below). The advantage over Cell Ranger is that it is much less computationally intensive and will run with lower memory requirements in a shorter time.\n\n- [Alevin](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html): This tool is based on the popular Salmon tool for bulk RNAseq feature counting and performs pseudoalignment, and therefore, it is significantly faster. Currently alevin supports the following single-cell protocols: Drop-seq, 10x-Chromium v1/2/3, inDropV2, CELSeq 1/2, Quartz-Seq2, sci-RNA-seq3.\n\n* [CellRanger](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/getting-started/cr-what-is-cell-ranger): A set of analysis pipelines developed by 10X (Cell Ranger actually uses STAR under the hood). This software does not only perform the alignment and feature counting, but will also call cells (i.e. filter the raw matrix to remove droplets that do not contain cells), generate a useful report in html format, which will provide some QC metrics and an initial look at the data, and generate a “cloupe” file, which can be opened using the [10x Loupe Browser](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/visualization/latest/what-is-loupe-cell-browser) software to further explore the data.\n\n  CellRanger is computationally very intensive because it performs both primary and secondary analysis steps. As a result, it cannot be run on a standard laptop or desktop computer; you will need access to a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. Since we are working with 10x Chromium–derived data, we will use CellRanger for this workshop. For detailed instructions, please refer to the CellRanger documentation on the [10x Genomics website](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger).\n\n  However, because secondary analysis requires careful tuning of parameters specific to each dataset, we do not recommend relying solely on CellRanger’s automated results. Instead, we will carry out the secondary and tertiary analysis steps using relevant R packages on Day 2 and 3 of the workshop.  \n  \n  You can also run 10x Genomics single cell pipelines with [10x Genomics Cloud Analysis](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/cloud-analysis), creating a free account. he analysis pipeline has some limitations, but usually performs well. You need to download your output within 3 months. \n\n<br>\n\n### From FASTQ File to Count Matrix\n\n![](images/workflow.webp){fig-cap=\"Workflow\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nIn bulk RNA-seq experiment, we usually run some QC checks on fastq files containing reads, then map the reads to a reference genome, and finally generate a count matrix for every gene across each sample. In single cell RNA-seq experiment, similarly, we generate a count matrix that represents the number of counts for every gene across each profiled cell in the experiment.  \n\nFor scRNA-seq data processing, we need these three components before we can start with the secondary and tertiary analysis:  \n- Sparse Matrix (MTX file) represents the count data in a compact format.  \n- Cell Metadata containing barcode information.  \n- Gene List that includes gene names and IDs.  \n\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nWe will be looking at the `count` tool of the CellRanger software to align the sequencing reads against the reference genome of your organism, quantify gene expression and call cells. To generate gene (feature) counts you will need:\n\n- **Linux** environment (workstation, HPC, or cloud) with enough RAM/CPU and disk space: we will be using [OSCER HPC](https://www.ou.edu/oscer/getting_started/getting_started_hpc_intro).  \n- **CellRanger (v8+ recommended; v9 current)**: it is already installed on OSCER.  \n- **FASTQs** demultiplexed from the sequencer (see “FASTQ naming”): we will provide these.  \n- A **reference transcriptome**: either **prebuilt on 10x website** or a **custom reference** you build with `mkref`.\n\n\n### Connecting to OSCER interactively\n\nTo perform the next steps, we will connect to OSCER interactively, since we do not want to overload the login node and risk receiving a dreaded email from [Dr. Henry Neeman, Director of the OU Supercomputing Center for Education & Research](https://www.ou.edu/oscer/people). \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nsrun --partition=sooner_test --container=el9hw --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=8G --pty bash -i\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"/Users/eleanacabello/Documents/bioinfo_projects/scRNAseq-workshop/scRNAseq-wshp/days-content/day-1-resources\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## 2. Genome References: prebuilt vs. custom\n\n### Option A: Use a prebuilt reference (easier if exist)\n10x publishes prebuilt reference packages for several organisms on its [website](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/downloads#reference-downloads). You can simply download the latest prebuilt reference (e.g., for mouse, refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A) following the script provided below and point `--transcriptome` to that folder. For a detailed script for how that reference was built, you can follow [the build steps](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/downloads/cr-ref-build-steps) on the 10 website for the references.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n# Downloading refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz from 10x website\nmkdir -p ~/refs\ncd ~/refs\ncurl -O \"https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz\"\ntar -xzvf refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz\nls -1 ~/refs/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Option B: Build a custom reference with `mkref`\nBuild a custom reference if you need non‑standard genomes, extra genes (e.g., reporters), or to align with a specific [Ensembl/GENCODE](https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html) release. You need the reference genome for your organism in FASTA format and the transcript annotation file in GTF format. As an example, see the code below for the human reference genome release 110 on Ensembl. You can also check the instructions given on 10X website to [build custom reference](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/analysis/inputs/cr-3p-references) for more details. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n# Example: set your Ensembl release and target directory\nREFDIR=/path/to/referenceGenome # change the directory as you prefer\nmkdir -p \"$REFDIR\" && cd \"$REFDIR\"\n\n# Update the URLs below to the current Ensembl release if needed\nwget -O Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.gtf.gz   https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.gtf.gz\n\n# Human genome FASTA (primary assembly)\nwget -O Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz\n\n# Decompress for mkref/mkgtf since mkref does not work with files compressed with gzip\ngunzip -f Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.gtf.gz\ngunzip -f Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**GTF (Gene Transfer Format)**  \n  \n![](images/GTFfile2.png){fig-cap=\"GTF file format\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n![](images/GTF_columns.png){fig-cap=\"GTF file format\" width=\"80%\"}\n\n- Used for genome annotation.  \n- Importantly for Cell Ranger Count, only features labelled as exon (column 3) will be considered for counting signal in genes.  \n- Many genomes label mitochondrial genes with CDS and not exon so these must be updated. \n\n\n**Optional but recommended:** 10x recommends filtering the GTF file so that it contains only gene categories of interest by using the `cellranger mkgtf` tool. Which genes to filter depends on your research question. Note that Cell Ranger does not use reads that map to multiple genes for expression (UMI) counting, so having overlapping genes in your reference will result in ignored reads. This filtering is recommended to avoid multi‑mapping from non‑polyA/non‑coding features. 10x demonstrates this with [`cellranger mkgtf`](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/analysis/inputs/cr-3p-references#filter-with-mkgtf-f4a9b6):\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n# Filter the gtf file to contain only protein coding exons:\n# cellranger mkgtf input.gtf output.gtf --attribute=key:allowable_value\n\ncellranger mkgtf \\\n  Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.gtf \\\n  Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.protein_coding.gtf \\\n  --attribute=gene_biotype:protein_coding\n  \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOther attributes that can be used for filtering in pre-built 10x Genomics references include:  \n\n- Protein-coding genes (`--attribute=gene_biotype:protein_coding`)  \n- Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (`--attribute=gene_biotype:lncRNA`)  \n- Antisense (`--attribute=gene_biotype:antisense`)  \n- Pseudogenes (`--attribute=gene_biotype:pseudogene`)  \n- V(D)J germline genes, for example:  \n  `--attribute=gene_biotype:IG_V_gene`   \n  `--attribute=gene_biotype:TR_V_gene`  \n\nNow we can create the Cell Ranger reference (this will produce a folder you pass to `--transcriptome` of the `cellranger count`).  \n\n**But we will not, because it takes too long:**  \n\n**System requirements:**. \nIndexing a typical human 3Gb FASTA file often takes up to 8 core hours and requires 32 GB of memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncellranger mkref \\\n  --nthreads={CPUS} \\\n  --genome=/path/to/output/genome/index \\\n  --fasta=/path/to/GenomeFASTA/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa \\\n  --genes=/path/to/GenomeGTF/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.protein_coding.gtf\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\nAbout **“include introns”**: Since Cell Ranger **v7**, intronic reads are **included by default** for whole‑transcriptome GEX, which makes a separate “pre‑mRNA” reference unnecessary for snRNA‑seq. Use `--include-introns=false` to count exonic reads only if you are running snRNA-seq.\n:::\n\n## 3. Running `cellranger count`\n\n**File naming:** Cell Ranger expects the Illumina convention: `Sample_S1_L00{lane}_{I1|I2|R1|R2}_001.fastq.gz`  \nLane‑less names like `Sample_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz` are also accepted (v4+).  \n\nBelow is a  template for a single‑sample run. For more information about `cellranger count` function check [10x website](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/tutorials/cr-tutorial-ct).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n# Resources (adjust to your node/request)\nCORES=64\nMEM_GB=128\n\n# Run\ncellranger count \\\n  --id={OUTPUT_SAMPLE_NAME} \\\n  --transcriptome=/path/to/output/genome/index \\\n  --fastqs=/path/to/fastqs \\\n  --sample={name-of-sample-as-in-fastq-files} \\\n  --chemistry=auto \\\n  --localcores=\"$CORES\" \\\n  --localmem=\"$MEM_GB\" \\\n  --create-bam=true\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Notes**:  \n\n- This script will process all fastqs in `--fastqs` dir unless `--sample` is used; if multiple samples share a dir, use `--sample` to restrict.  \n- `--chemistry=auto` is the default and works for 3′ vs 5′ kits in most cases. Override only if the kit is unusual.  \n\n## 4. Outputs you’ll use\nCell Ranger will create a single results folder for each sample names. Each folder will be named according to the `--id` option in the command.\n\n![](images/output.png){fig-cap=\"output tree\" width=\"30%\"}\n\n<br>\n\nEach run creates `<ID>/outs/` with (key items):\n\n![](images/output_out.png){fig-cap=\"output out tree\" width=\"50%\"} \n\n- `analysis` : The results of clustering and differential expression analysis on the clusters. These are used in the web_summary.html report.  \n- `cloupe.cloupe` : a cloupe file that can be opened in Loupe Browser for quick inspection  \n- `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` : The filtered count matrix directory  \n- `filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5` : The filtered count matrix as an HDF5 file  \n- `metrics_summary.csv` : summary metrics from the analysis  \n- `molecule_info.h5` : per-molecule read information as an HDF5 file  \n- `possorted_genome_bam.bam` : The aligned reads in bam format  \n- `possorted_genome_bam.bam.bai` : The bam index  \n- `raw_feature_bc_matrix` : The raw count matrix directory  \n- `raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5` : The raw count matrix as an HDF5 file  \n- `web_summary.html` : interactive QC summary  \n\n<br>\n\nThe two count matrix directories each contain 3 files:  \n![](images/output_out_matrix.png){fig-cap=\"output out tree\" width=\"30%\"} \n\n- `barcodes.tsv.gz` : The cell barcodes detected; these correspond to the columns of the count matrix  \n- `features.tsv.gz` : The features detected. In this cases gene ids. These correspond to the rows of the count matrix.  \n- `matrix.mtx.gz` : the count of unique UMIs for each gene in each cell.  \n\nThe count matrix directories and their corresponding HDF5 files contain the same information, they are just alternative formats for use depending on the tools that are used for analysis.  \n\nThe filtered count matrix only contains droplets that have been called as cells by CellRanger.  \n\n## 5. Understanding the QC summary `web_summary.html`\nThe cellranger count pipeline outputs an interactive summary HTML file named `web_summary.html` that contains summary metrics and automated secondary analysis results. It has Summary and Gene Expression tabs. For a general intro you can read [this link here](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/analysis/outputs/cr-outputs-web-summary-count).  \n\n![](images/web_summary_1.png){fig-cap=\"output out tree\" width=\"100%\"} \n\nClick the `?` icons next to each section title to display information about the secondary analyses shown in the dashboard.  \n\nThe Barcode Rank Plot is an interactive plot that shows all barcodes detected in an experiment, ranked from highest to lowest UMI count. It is useful for understanding [Cell Ranger’s cell calling algorithm](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/algorithms-overview/cr-gex-algorithm#cell_calling) to gain insight into your sample quality. \n \nBelow is a Barcode Rank Plot from a good sample:\n\n![](images/BarcodeRankPlot.png){fig-cap=\"output out tree\" width=\"80%\"} \n\n\nAnd here are some not so good ones:\n![](images/badsample1.png){fig-cap=\"output out tree\" width=\"80%\"} \n\n![](images/badsample2.png){fig-cap=\"output out tree\" width=\"80%\"} \n\n![](images/badsample3.png){fig-cap=\"output out tree\" width=\"80%\"} \n\n\nFor a more detailed explanation on the interpretation of web summary files see [this](https://cdn.10xgenomics.com/image/upload/v1660261286/support-documents/CG000329_TechnicalNote_InterpretingCellRangerWebSummaryFiles_RevA.pdf) info sheet from 10X.\n\n## 6.
