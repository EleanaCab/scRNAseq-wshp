Specifically, the mice used for these experiments had a mutation in the Ift88 gene, which is required for primary cilia formation. In the absence of Ift88 and primary cilia, mice gradual develop cysts and fibrosis throughout the kidney parenchyma.\nCaggcreERT2 Ift88f/f mice were induced with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age, resulting in loss of primary cilia in the majority of cells in the kidney. Mice were harvested ~7 months post tamoxifen injection and kidneys isolated, digested with collagenase, Fluorescence-Activated Cell (FAC) sorted, and subjected to single cell RNA sequencing using 10X genomics.\nThe manuscript associated with this data can be found here: A Comprehensive Immune Cell Atlas of Cystic Kidney Disease Reveals the Involvement of Adaptive Immune Cells in Injury-Mediated Cyst Progression in Mice",

They will learn how to import their data into R, build and manage a Seurat object, perform cell clustering, and carry out cell-type annotation.\nThe final session will provide hands-on experience with more advanced analyses, including pseudotime trajectory inference, cell–cell communication, and pathway or transcription factor activity analysis.",
