Specifically, the mice used for these experiments had a mutation in the Ift88 gene, which is required for primary cilia formation. In the absence of Ift88 and primary cilia, mice gradual develop cysts and fibrosis throughout the kidney parenchyma.\nCaggcreERT2 Ift88f/f mice were induced with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age, resulting in loss of primary cilia in the majority of cells in the kidney. Mice were harvested ~7 months post tamoxifen injection and kidneys isolated, digested with collagenase, Fluorescence-Activated Cell (FAC) sorted, and subjected to single cell RNA sequencing using 10X genomics.\nThe manuscript associated with this data can be found here: A Comprehensive Immune Cell Atlas of Cystic Kidney Disease Reveals the Involvement of Adaptive Immune Cells in Injury-Mediated Cyst Progression in Mice",

    "section": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "1. Introduction\nSingle cell RNA-seq workflows are typically broken into three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary analysis. Primary analysis handles the initial processing of raw sequencing output, including assigning reads to samples based on their barcode indices and trimming the reads. Then the reads are aligned to a reference and a quantitative measures of gene expression is generated as a count matrix. Secondary analysis involves dimensionality reduction and clustering, and finally tertiary analysis centers on interpreting the data biologically, most of the time through annotating the cells and performing differential gene expression testing and enrichment analyses such as GO or gene set enrichment.\nThere are several analysis pipelines developed to perform the primary analysis step of the single cell data analysis and your choice sometimes depend on the method by which the library was generated:\n\nSTAR solo: This tool is built into the general purpose STAR aligner and generates outputs very similar to Cell Ranger minus the cloupe file and the QC report (see below). The advantage over Cell Ranger is that it is much less computationally intensive and will run with lower memory requirements in a shorter time.\nAlevin: This tool is based on the popular Salmon tool for bulk RNAseq feature counting and performs pseudoalignment, and therefore, it is significantly faster. Currently alevin supports the following single-cell protocols: Drop-seq, 10x-Chromium v1/2/3, inDropV2, CELSeq 1/2, Quartz-Seq2, sci-RNA-seq3.\nCellRanger: A set of analysis pipelines developed by 10X (Cell Ranger actually uses STAR under the hood). This software does not only perform the alignment and feature counting, but will also call cells (i.e. filter the raw matrix to remove droplets that do not contain cells), generate a useful report in html format, which will provide some QC metrics and an initial look at the data, and generate a “cloupe” file, which can be opened using the 10x Loupe Browser software to further explore the data.\nCellRanger is computationally very intensive because it performs both primary and secondary analysis steps. As a result, it cannot be run on a standard laptop or desktop computer; you will need access to a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. Since we are working with 10x Chromium–derived data, we will use CellRanger for this workshop. For detailed instructions, please refer to the CellRanger documentation on the 10x Genomics website.\nHowever, because secondary analysis requires careful tuning of parameters specific to each dataset, we do not recommend relying solely on CellRanger’s automated results. Instead, we will carry out the secondary and tertiary analysis steps using relevant R packages on Day 2 and 3 of the workshop.\nYou can also run 10x Genomics single cell pipelines with 10x Genomics Cloud Analysis, creating a free account. he analysis pipeline has some limitations, but usually performs well. You need to download your output within 3 months.\n\n\n\nFrom FASTQ File to Count Matrix\n\nIn bulk RNA-seq experiment, we usually run some QC checks on fastq files containing reads, then map the reads to a reference genome, and finally generate a count matrix for every gene across each sample. In single cell RNA-seq experiment, similarly, we generate a count matrix that represents the number of counts for every gene across each profiled cell in the experiment.\nFor scRNA-seq data processing, we need these three components before we can start with the secondary and tertiary analysis:\n- Sparse Matrix (MTX file) represents the count data in a compact format.\n- Cell Metadata containing barcode information.\n- Gene List that includes gene names and IDs.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nWe will be looking at the count tool of the CellRanger software to align the sequencing reads against the reference genome of your organism, quantify gene expression and call cells. To generate gene (feature) counts you will need:\n\nLinux environment (workstation, HPC, or cloud) with enough RAM/CPU and disk space: we will be using OSCER HPC.\n\nCellRanger (v8+ recommended; v9 current): it is already installed on OSCER.\n\nFASTQs demultiplexed from the sequencer (see “FASTQ naming”): we will provide these.\n\nA reference transcriptome: either prebuilt on 10x website or a custom reference you build with mkref.\n\n\n\nConnecting to OSCER interactively\nTo perform the next steps, we will connect to OSCER interactively, since we do not want to overload the login node and risk receiving a dreaded email from Dr. Henry Neeman, Director of the OU Supercomputing Center for Education & Research.\n\nsrun --partition=sooner_test --container=el9hw --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=8G --pty bash -i"

    "section": "2. Genome References: prebuilt vs. custom",
    "text": "2. Genome References: prebuilt vs. custom\n\nOption A: Use a prebuilt reference (easier if exist)\n10x publishes prebuilt reference packages for several organisms on its website. You can simply download the latest prebuilt reference (e.g., for mouse, refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A) following the script provided below and point --transcriptome to that folder. For a detailed script for how that reference was built, you can follow the build steps on the 10 website for the references.\n\n# Downloading refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz from 10x website\nmkdir -p ~/refs\ncd ~/refs\ncurl -O \"https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz\"\ntar -xzvf refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz\nls -1 ~/refs/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A\n\n\nOption B: Build a custom reference with mkref\nBuild a custom reference if you need non‑standard genomes, extra genes (e.g., reporters), or to align with a specific Ensembl/GENCODE release. You need the reference genome for your organism in FASTA format and the transcript annotation file in GTF format. As an example, see the code below for the human reference genome release 110 on Ensembl. You can also check the instructions given on 10X website to build custom reference for more details.\n# Example: set your Ensembl release and target directory\nREFDIR=/path/to/referenceGenome # change the directory as you prefer\nmkdir -p \"$REFDIR\" && cd \"$REFDIR\"\n\n# Update the URLs below to the current Ensembl release if needed\nwget -O Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.gtf.gz   https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.gtf.gz\n\n# Human genome FASTA (primary assembly)\nwget -O Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz\n\n# Decompress for mkref/mkgtf since mkref does not work with files compressed with gzip\ngunzip -f Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.gtf.gz\ngunzip -f Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz\nGTF (Gene Transfer Format)\n\n\n\nUsed for genome annotation.\n\nImportantly for Cell Ranger Count, only features labelled as exon (column 3) will be considered for counting signal in genes.\n\nMany genomes label mitochondrial genes with CDS and not exon so these must be updated.\n\nOptional but recommended: 10x recommends filtering the GTF file so that it contains only gene categories of interest by using the cellranger mkgtf tool. Which genes to filter depends on your research question. Note that Cell Ranger does not use reads that map to multiple genes for expression (UMI) counting, so having overlapping genes in your reference will result in ignored reads. This filtering is recommended to avoid multi‑mapping from non‑polyA/non‑coding features. 10x demonstrates this with cellranger mkgtf:\n# Filter the gtf file to contain only protein coding exons:\n# cellranger mkgtf input.gtf output.gtf --attribute=key:allowable_value\n\ncellranger mkgtf \\\n  Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.gtf \\\n  Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.protein_coding.gtf \\\n  --attribute=gene_biotype:protein_coding\n  \nOther attributes that can be used for filtering in pre-built 10x Genomics references include:\n\nProtein-coding genes (--attribute=gene_biotype:protein_coding)\n\nLong intergenic noncoding RNAs (--attribute=gene_biotype:lncRNA)\n\nAntisense (--attribute=gene_biotype:antisense)\n\nPseudogenes (--attribute=gene_biotype:pseudogene)\n\nV(D)J germline genes, for example:\n--attribute=gene_biotype:IG_V_gene\n--attribute=gene_biotype:TR_V_gene\n\nNow we can create the Cell Ranger reference (this will produce a folder you pass to --transcriptome of the cellranger count).\nBut we will not, because it takes too long:\nSystem requirements:. Indexing a typical human 3Gb FASTA file often takes up to 8 core hours and requires 32 GB of memory.\ncellranger mkref \\\n  --nthreads={CPUS} \\\n  --genome=/path/to/output/genome/index \\\n  --fasta=/path/to/GenomeFASTA/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa \\\n  --genes=/path/to/GenomeGTF/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.protein_coding.gtf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAbout “include introns”: Since Cell Ranger v7, intronic reads are included by default for whole‑transcriptome GEX, which makes a separate “pre‑mRNA” reference unnecessary for snRNA‑seq. Use --include-introns=false to count exonic reads only if you are running snRNA-seq."

It’s always a good idea to check every component of your run before you put your sbatch file together.\n\n# Load the cell ranger module (if you cannot remember versions, run &lt;module spider cellranger&gt; and it will list installed software with similar names)\nmodule load CellRanger/8.0.1\n\n# Check Cell Ranger is activated\ncellranger --version\n\n# To see the help\ncellranger --help\nTo run a software on OSCER we need to submit our jobs over a workload manager called SLURM.\n\nBatch Jobs\n\n#!/usr/bin/bash -l\n\n#SBATCH --job-name=CR_single\n#SBATCH --partition=el9_test\n#SBATCH --container=el9hw\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=64\n#SBATCH --mem=128G\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\n#SBATCH --chdir=/path/to/your/output/\n#\n#===============================================================================\n\n\nset -euo pipefail\n\nmodule load CellRanger/8.0.1\n\ncd &lt;/path/to/your/output/&gt;\n\ns=&lt;give your sample name here&gt;\n\necho \"* $(date) | START sample: $s\" &gt;&gt; \"${s}.out\"\n\ncellranger count \\\n        --id \"$s\" \\\n        --sample \"$s\" \\\n        --fastqs \"/path/to/fastqs\" \\\n        --transcriptome \"/path/to/genome/index\" \\\n        --localcores 64 \\\n        --localmem 128 \\\n        --create-bam true \\\n        --disable-ui \\\n        --output-dir \"/path/to/your/output/${s}\" \\\n        &gt;&gt; \"${s}.out\" 2&gt;&gt; \"${s}.err\"\n\necho \"**** $(date) | DONE sample: $s\" &gt;&gt; \"${s}.out\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nResource control Cell Ranger can use most available cores/RAM; constrain with --localcores and --localmem to match your scheduler request.\n\nDisk space Keep ~3–4× input FASTQ size free for temporary files and outputs.\n\nFASTQ selection If a directory holds multiple samples, use --sample to restrict to the intended prefix.\nsnRNA‑seq Introns are counted by default (v7+); you do not need a pre‑mRNA reference.\nChemistry detection By default the assay configuration is detected automatically, leave it out unless you have reason to override; if you must, set --chemistry to one of the accepted values (e.g., threeprime, fiveprime, etc.).\nHere is the link for more on Cell Ranger Command Line Arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPathway to data for this workshop\n\n\n\nfastq files are under: \"/ourdisk/hpc/iicomicswshp/dont_archive/omics_workshop_2025/mouse_kidney_all_cells_raw_data/\"\nreference is under: \"/ourdisk/hpc/iicomicswshp/dont_archive/master_folder/omics_class_scripts/data/sc/refs/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning samples serially\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n#SBATCH --job-name=CR_serial\n#SBATCH --partition=el9_test\n#SBATCH --container=el9hw\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=64\n#SBATCH --mem=128G\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\n#SBATCH --chdir=/path/to/your/output/\n\n\nset -euo pipefail\n\nmodule load CellRanger/8.0.1\n\ncd &lt;/path/to/your/output/&gt;\n\n# this will run samples one after the other (serially):\n# make sure there is no empty spaces or empty lines in the ids.txt\nIDS=\"/ourdisk/hpc/iicomicswshp/dont_archive/omics_workshop_2025/mouse_kidney_all_cells_raw_data/ids.txt\"\n\nfor s in $(cat \"$IDS\"); do\n\n    echo \"* $(date) | START sample: $s\" &gt;&gt; \"${s}.out\"\n\n    cellranger count \\\n        --id \"$s\" \\\n        --sample \"$s\" \\\n        --fastqs \"/path/to/fastqs\" \\\n        --transcriptome \"/path/to/genome/index\" \\\n        --localcores 64 \\\n        --localmem 128 \\\n        --create-bam true \\\n        --disable-ui \\\n        --output-dir \"/path/to/your/output/${s}\" \\\n        &gt;&gt; \"${s}.out\" 2&gt;&gt; \"${s}.err\"\n\n    echo \"**** $(date) | DONE sample: $s\" &gt;&gt; \"${s}.out\"\n\ndone\n\necho \"All samples finished.\""

If you aren’t familiar with them yet, here’s a quick introduction.\nBelow is a simple example of a for loop:\nfor file in dir/*; do\n    echo \"$file\"\ndone\nLet’s walk through what this code is doing:\nFirst line: for file in dir/*; do This tells Bash: “For every file in the directory dir, do the following actions.” As the loop runs, the variable file will take on the name of each file in that directory, one at a time.\nSecond line: echo \"$file\" This is the action we want to perform for each file. In this example, we’re simply printing the file’s name to the screen. In today’s session, you will be processing files using CellRanger.\nThird line: done This marks the end of the loop. Once a file has been processed and the actions are completed, Bash moves on to the next file and repeats the process until all files have been handled.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Location\n/ourdisk/hpc/iicomicswshp/dont_archive/omics_workshop_2025/mouse_kidney_all_cells_raw_data\n\n\nSession Objectives\n\nSet up all required R packages locally for the remainder of the workshop\nUnderstand sample preparation workflows for single-cell sequencing using different library kits\nUse CellRanger for barcode processing and UMI counting to quantify gene expression\n\n\n\nSession Materials\n\nMorning Slides by Kylie Williams\nAfternoon Slides by Hande Acar - Standalone Guide for Afternoon Session\n\n\n\nSummary\nThis session introduces participants to the primary steps of processing 10x Genomics single-cell RNA-seq data using the Cell Ranger software suite. We begin by outlining the major stages of single-cell analysis—from handling raw FASTQ files to generating a usable gene-by-cell count matrix—and discuss the computational requirements necessary to run Cell Ranger efficiently on the OSCER high-performance computing system.\nParticipants learn how to work with genome references (both prebuilt and custom), prepare sequencing data, and execute cellranger count to perform alignment, UMI processing, quantification, and where to find essential output files. By the end, attendees understand how to run primary analysis reproducibly on an HPC environment and are prepared for downstream secondary and tertiary analysis in R on subsequent workshop days.\nOther helpful resources:\n\nHow single cell sequencing data analysis works",
